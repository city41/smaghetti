x = don't care
A = number of cards
B = card number
C = Data length * 2
D = Application Type - 0 = GBA/Z80 type, 1 = NES type
E = Individual card title mode bit
F = Permission to save bit

	If the type is 2,3,4, or 5, then the Maximum title length is 16 characters,
	Otherwise, if it is E, then the maximum is 32 characters. 
	The header format is identical between the two.

	If the card is in individual card title mode, then the number of titles that have to
	follow the application title depends on how many cards are in the set.  If the number
	of cards in the set exceeds 8, no individual card titles are displayed, instead, the
	ereader logo is displayed. Even though this is the case, you still have to specify
	the individual card titles.  Therefore, it is best not to use this mode if the set
	is going to require 9 or more cards.  What might fit on 8 cards in normal title mode,
	may just require 9 cards in individual title mode, depending on how many bytes are 
	required by the compressed application vpk data.

	Formats 2,3,4,5 - Card titles follow a format of 3 bytes stats, followed by an 17
	character title.

			A = ID: 01-99,A0-A9,B0-B9,C0-C8 (x-AA-x)
			B = ID: A-G,# (x-xx-B)
			C = HP: 10-150.  A value of 0 means no HP is displayed.
			D = ID: A-Z,-,_,{HP},.,{ID},: (D-xx-x)
			E = Stat display control. 1 = no stat display.
			F = unknown.

	Format E - Card titles are 32 bytes each.

	If the title is NULL, and there is only one card in the application, then the
	application is started immediately, upon successful scanning. A NULL titled
	application cannot be saved, as the e-reader treats that as having no application
	on the save.

	If the vpk length - 2 immediately follows the vpk data, then the application
	is either Z80 code type, or NES code type, depending on whether the Application
	type bit was set or cleered.
	However, if the vpk length - 6 follows 4 bytes of 0s, then the vpk data, the
	application is GBA code type.  The application type bit must remain cleared.

	The max number of application cards is 8 on the original japan ereader, and 12 on
	the US ereader and Japan ereader plus.

	The original jap E-Reader does not support the GBA/NES application types. Title
	formats have to always be individual title mode. Z80 application controller input
	is on a different register. Title length in short title mode is 4 bytes less. 
	Those 4 bytes must be 0 filled.
