					<p>
						All liquid terrains are now done using a drag handle, similar to how
						things like Colorful Metal Box work. The old way of
						&quot;painting&quot; the tiles is not good enough for these
						entities, as in more complex scenarios Smaghetti was unable to
						figure out how you wanted your liquid to work. For example,
						Smaghetti would build bodies of water that looked like this:
					</p>
					<img
						width={480}
						height={320}
						src={badWaterExamplePng}
						alt="Screenshot showing Smaghetti not creating water correctly"
					/>
					<p>
						With the new way liquid entities are handled, you can now get the
						expected result:
					</p>
					<img
						width={480}
						height={320}
						src={goodWaterExamplePng}
						alt="Screenshot showing Smaghetti now creating the water correctly"
					/>
					<p>
						But! If Smaghetti was making bad liquid for you before, you will
						need to go into your level and fix it using the new entities. The
						old liquid tiles will be replaced automatically for you, but the bad
						scenarios can not be automatically fixed. In other words, the above
						scenario will first look like this in the editor:
					</p>
					<img
						width={582}
						height={255}
						src={convertedButNotFixedPng}
						alt="Screenshot showing Smaghetti has converted the entities, but not fixed the problem"

						And you will need to manually fix up your level to get the correct
						water.

						Vertical pipes are close, but still some things to figure out. You
						can try one out by grabbing it from the Unfinished tab in the
						palette.
					</p>
					<p>
						Technically piranha plants can work without pipes, but they look
						broken. To stick it in a pipe, just drop it on top of the pipe with
						its mouth just below the pipe&apos;s lip. Remember you can lock
						either the stage or actor layers as needed to make this easier.

						Conveyor belts now have a more intuitive and easier way to set them
